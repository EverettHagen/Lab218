If you choose to go the python route, you will first need to download Oskar's code [here](https://github.com/ohartbri/dt5202_stuff). It wil be most conveinet if you then proceed by creating all of your new files in the same folder that you store this. 

Next you will need to go into your terminal, assuming you use linux/unix this should be easy. 
1. Go into the folder where you store Oskar's code.
2. Run something along the lines of :
    ```python3 dt5202_parse_v36.py -p /path/to/your/file/RunXXX_list.txt ```
3. When it's done it'll print  ```/path/to/your/file/RunXXX_list.txt: pandas done.``` You can find the .pkl file in the same folder that the .txt file is in.
