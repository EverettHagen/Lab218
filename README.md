# Welcome to the PHYS 393 Github!
This contains a couple of files that I think will help speed up your learning. They are all optional and you don't need to follow along if you don't want. I just want to give you an option!

## Coding_guide
- This will help guide you through the Python code. If you choose to use this, you need to **first** go through the 'WorkingWithDataFrame' code.
- It will be most helpful to go through the 'LookingAtCosmics' file next then the 'SPSFitting', however these can be more interchangeable.
### Troubleshooting 
- If you need help, feel free to reach out! I would suggest looking at the documentation I've inculded in the files, or ones that I have not. These are incredibly helpful for actually understanding what a fucntion does.
- I also recommend if you don't understand something, create another file with a much more simplied version of what you are doing.
- You can also print out variables if you don't understand what they do. This is especially helpful when working with the dataframe.
